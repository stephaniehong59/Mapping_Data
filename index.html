<p>Starting from March 1, 2026, the Able-Bodied Adult Without Dependents (ABAWD) rule will return and make SNAP participants’ food budget in the NYC tighter. People between 18 and 64 without children under 14 years old must work paid or unpaid at least 20 hours a week to maintain their SNAP benefits.</p>


<p>Dr. Jera Qianhui Zhang, an Assistant Professor of Nutrition and Public Health at Hunter College, sees that confusion over benefit continuity, eligibility rules, and future policy changes led some households to delay food purchases, reduce diet variety, or shift toward lower-cost, more energy-dense foods. </p>

<p>“This uncertainty can cause anxiety about eligibility and may lead some households to cut back on food purchases, which can negatively affect diet quality and overall health.”</p>
 
<p>Zhang said that SNAP makes up for low wages or supports people when they are temporarily out of work. With stricter work requirements, fewer people will stay on SNAP, leading to more food insecurity and poorer diet quality without clear improvements in employment rate or income.</p>
